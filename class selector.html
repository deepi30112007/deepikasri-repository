            Delhi blast death toll: The blast near the Red Fort in capital Delhi, which claimed 13 lives, has shaken the nation. Security forces are now scrambling to find clues as to what led to the blast.
             Forensics teams, Delhi police and NIA personnel, and dog squads are at the spot to collect samples and evidence. A case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been registered.
            Several states, such as Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir, are on high alert following the Delhi blast.
        </p>
        <p class="nation">
            The explosion occurred at 6:52 PM inside a Hyundai i20, which was standing at a red light. As the blast radius spread, the flames engulfed the other vehicles around it.
          Witnesses claimed two-three people were sitting in the Hyundai i20 at the time.

    <h2 class="sports">Kerala Blasters suspend operations temporarily</h2>
    <h3 class="sports">Amid uncertainty around the Indian Super League (ISL), Kerala Blasters (KBFC) became the third top-flight club – after Odisha FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant — to temporarily suspend operations, following its exit from the Super Cup.</h3>

        “There’s a lot that needs to be considered before making decisions.
         But equally, if you understand from a club standpoint, we are staring into an abyss with no information, which is not good.”
     </p> 
     <p class="sports">
         However, the situation has not gotten better, since the tender for a new commercial partner for ISL has found no bidders, leading to KBFC hitting the pause button yet again.
        “It puts a lot of stress on the owners, obviously, the players, and the staff, because there are specialised staff whose livelihood depends on football,” Abhik added.
        “But I would like to remain an optimist and hope that the sooner we have clarity, the better.”

     <h1 class="state">How Tamil Nadu witnessed the dramatic arrest and release of Karunanidhi and Stalin in 2001</h1>
     <h2 class="state">In June 2001, former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s midnight arrest sparked political outrage. Police dragged him from his home and later arrested M.K. Stalin and others in connection with alleged irregularities in the construction of 10 flyovers in Chennai.
        Events surrounding the dramatic arrest of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in June 2001 have come into focus again in the wake of observations by a Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) functionary about the whereabouts of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the time of the incident.</h2>
     <h3 class="state">It was a fact that Mr. Stalin, then Chennai Mayor, was not in the city when a team of police officials went to the Oliver Road residence of his father during the intervening night of June 29 and 30 to arrest him in connection with alleged irregularities in the construction of 10 flyovers in Chennai, according to a perusal of materials available with The Hindu archives.
         Mr. Stalin, whom the police could not trace in the early hours of the day, said he had gone to Bangalore (now Bengaluru) to meet a relative, this newspaper reported on July 1. Once he knew the police were looking for him, he had returned to Chennai and surrendered before Principal Sessions Judge S. Ashok Kumar, who remanded him in judicial custody till July 10.
